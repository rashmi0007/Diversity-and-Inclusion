# Pwc Switzerland - Power BI Virtual Case Experience - Diversity and Inclusion Analysis

## Problem Statement :
This project was based on Power BI, where an HR Diversity and Inclusion dataset was analyzed, a Power BI dashboard report was being designed, and KPIs were defined to measure the organization's progress.

The following actions could assist in establishing appropriate KPIs:-

â€¢  '#' of men

â€¢  '#' of women

â€¢  '#' of leavers

â€¢  % turnover

â€¢  Average performance rating: Men

â€¢  Average performance rating: Women


## Datasource :
Dataset used for this task was presented by [Pwc Switzerland](https://www.pwc.ch/en/careers-with-pwc/students/virtual-case-experience.html) and can be downloaded directly from [here](https://github.com/rashmi0007/Diversity-and-Inclusion/blob/master/03%20Diversity-Inclusion-Dataset.xlsx).

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies Used in project :
â–ª Power BI Desktop

â–ª DAX

â–ª MS Excel

â–ª PowerPoint (For Dashboard background design)

## Data Analysis :
Measures used in visualization are:

â€¢  Total Employee =  DISTINCTCOUNTNOBLANK('Peoples Details'[Employee ID])

â€¢  Avg Perf Rating Men =  CALCULATE(AVERAGE('Peoples Details'[FY20 Performance Rating]),FILTER('Peoples Details','Peoples Details'[Gender]="Male"))

â€¢  Avg Perf Rating Women =  CALCULATE(AVERAGE('Peoples Details'[FY20 Performance Rating]),FILTER('Peoples Details','Peoples Details'[Gender]="Female"))

â€¢  Employees Promoted in 2020 =  CALCULATE([Total Employee],FILTER('Peoples Details','Peoples Details'[Promotion in FY20?]="Y"))

â€¢  Employees Promoted in 2021 =  CALCULATE([Total Employee],FILTER('Peoples Details','Peoples Details'[Promotion in FY21?]="Yes"))

â€¢  Leaver =  CALCULATE([Total Employee],FILTER('Peoples Details','Peoples Details'[Leaver FY] IN {"FY20"}))

â€¢  Men Count =  CALCULATE([Total Employee],'Peoples Details'[Gender]="Male")

â€¢  Women Count =  CALCULATE([Total Employee],'Peoples Details'[Gender]="Female")

â€¢  New Hire 2020 =  CALCULATE([Total Employee],FILTER('Peoples Details','Peoples Details'[New hire FY20?]="Y"))

â€¢  % Turnover =  DIVIDE(CALCULATE(DISTINCTCOUNTNOBLANK('Peoples Details'[Employee ID]),FILTER('Peoples Details','Peoples Details'[FY20 leaver?]="Yes")),Divide(Calculate(distinctcount('Peoples Details'[Employee ID]),Filter('Peoples Details','Peoples Details'[In base group for turnover FY20]="Y"))+Calculate(DISTINCTCOUNT('Peoples Details'[Employee ID]),Filter('Peoples Details',NOT('Peoples Details'[Department @01.07.2020]=BLANK()))),2))
